"""This module manages all the components of a computer vision scene.

Classes are used to manage all the people and things in a scene. Every scene has
a place as well, which is managed by the Place class.

    Typical usage example:

"""


class Person():
    """Maintains properties for a person object."""
    pass


class Place():
    """Maintains properties about the location of a scene."""
    pass


class Thing():
    """Maintains properties for things that are objects."""
    pass

class Scene():
    """Maintains a coherent scene narrative consisting of locations, paths,
    collisions, and Person-Thing contacts."""
    pass
